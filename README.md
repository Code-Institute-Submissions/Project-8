# Testing
#### Links & button
The main purpose of the test on links and buttons is to ensure that there are no bronken links or hyperlinks.
* Navbar - clicked on navbar menus to test if the links work to bring users to the clicked pages.
* Button - button on the main landing page was tested if it is able to bring users to the Resume page (For other buttons, I did not assign any links)
* Icons & phone number in the footer.
   * Social Media Icons were tested whether it is correctly redirect users to the pages.
   * Email Icon was tested whether if is able to trigger a Write A New Email page for the users for their easier user experience.
   * Phone number was tested whether it is able to trigger a call to my phone number when the users opens the website in their phones.
#### Images
The main purpose of the test on the images is to ensure that there are no broken images or images not shown.
* The background image in the main landing page was now shown when it was opend in my sister's iPhone XR. In other family members' and friends' phone or laptio, it was nicely presented though.
(input image) This issue is still remained unresolved.
#### Responsive Design
The main purpose of the test on the responsive disign is to ensure that the website works in different sizes of the media.
* Used Inspection function in Google Chrome to test the responsive design in different sizes of the media.
   * Navbar and the Skills page was works fine as I used Bootstrap to design from the first. 
   * However the main page was not responsive according to the size. Some of the typography on top on the page was hidden under navbar and the View Resume button was out of the background image. To resolve this, I tried to rebuil the main landing page with Jumbotron in Bootstrap, but it also was not able to resolve the problem. In the end, I used media query and adjust the font sizes and buttons so that they can nicely fit in responsively. 
   * Also Contact page looked not organized when it was shown on different sizes of the media. I changed the grid to 'col-sm' in Bootstrap and also align the text and Submit button in the center. After that, it looked more organized for users' view.
* All the font-size, margin, padding in CSS have been rectified to em or % from px.
* Used media query in CSS to ensure that all are responsive in different media sizes.
* Run the website in 'Am I Responsive' (http://ami.responsivedesign.is) to virtually test before sending out the deployed URL to family and friends.
* Send the deployed URL to family members and friends to test whether the website works without broken images and links in different media sizes (Test was done on Galaxy S2, iPhone XR, Oppo R11, Galaxy Tab A and thier laptops).
* Tested on different browsers (Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer )to ensure that the website works fine. 
   * Google Chrome - no issues detected as this is where I designed and developed the website
   * Safari - no issue detected
   * Firefox - No major issue detected. However the main landing page appeared nicely on the full screen starting from 110% of view. 
   * Internet Exporer - The typography used in Korean word was not appeared as designed. I used Gamja Flower font using Google Fonts for the words. However it was not shown with Gamja Flower and the font size was also appeared bigger (input image). This issue is still remain unresolved.
#### Deployment
Github pages was used to host the website, deployed directly from the master branch.
